3
0:09:00,000 --> 0:11:00,000
Sun’s off

4
0:11:00,000 --> 0:13:00,000
She won’t budge

5
0:13:00,000 --> 0:18:00,000
Down the jungle on her knees

6
0:18:00,000 --> 0:20:00,000
We’ll go

7
0:20:00,000 --> 0:21:00,000
To where we know

8
0:21:00,000 --> 0:25:00,000
Tame the wine drops, stumble down the hills

9
0:25:00,000 --> 0:28:00,000
You got to close your eyes and let them fly, you got to

10
0:28:00,000 --> 0:30:00,000
Drink your tears and sing your fears

11
0:30:00,000 --> 0:34:00,000
Listen to the rumble over rain

12
0:34:00,000 --> 0:37:00,000
And as the flames burned down

13
0:37:00,000 --> 0:39:00,000
We ran ourselves to hide

14
0:39:00,000 --> 0:43:00,000
And heard the words they cried:

15
0:43:00,000 --> 0:47:00,000
He-e-ey

16
0:47:00,000 --> 0:51:00,000
Don’t you run don’t you move until they see

17
0:51:00,000 --> 0:56:00,000
He-e-ey

18
0:56:00,000 --> 1:18:00,000
We’re made of dust and ivory

19
1:18:00,000 --> 1:20:00,000
Sun’s off

20
1:20:00,000 --> 1:22:00,000
A child asleep

21
1:22:00,000 --> 1:26:00,000
Swings the ashes to the sea

22
1:26:00,000 --> 1:28:00,000
Will they

23
1:28:00,000 --> 1:30:00,000
Remember me

24
1:30:00,000 --> 1:33:00,000
As the creatures live on peacefully

25
1:33:00,000 --> 1:36:00,000
You got to close your eyes and let them fly， you got to

26
1:36:00,000 --> 1:38:00,000
Drink your tears and sing your fears

27
1:38:00,000 --> 1:42:00,000
Listen to the rumble over pain

28
1:42:00,000 --> 1:45:00,000
And as the flames burned down

29
1:45:00,000 --> 1:47:00,000
We looked the otherside

30
1:47:00,000 --> 1:52:00,000
And heard the way they lied:

31
1:52:00,000 --> 1:55:00,000
He-e-ey

32
1:55:00,000 --> 2:00:00,000
Don’t you run don’t you move until they see

33
2:00:00,000 --> 2:04:00,000
He-e-ey

34
2:04:00,000 --> 2:09:00,000
We’re made of dust and ivory

35
2:09:00,000 --> 2:13:00,000
He-e-ey

36
2:13:00,000 --> 2:17:00,000
Don’t you run don’t you move until they see

37
2:17:00,000 --> 2:21:00,000
He-e-ey

38
2:21:00,000 --> 2:21:00,000
We’re made of dust and ivory
